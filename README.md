## Hi, I am Alejandro ðŸ‘‹

I am always looking to learn and to code to help companies achieve their goals through technology and automation.

- I focus mostly on Typescript and Javascript.
- I tend to prefer working on the backend than the frontend, but can do both.
- I am into cloud development, mostly AWS.
