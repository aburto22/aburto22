### Hi, I am Alejandro ðŸ‘‹

I am a Full-Stack JavaScript developer who loves the back-end as much as the front-end. My aim is to build simple and elegant sites with no distractions, so users can focus on what it is most relevant.

#### What's going on?

I recently completed a bootcamp at <Salt /> (School of Applied Technology) and got engaged as Full-Stack JavaScript developer consultant. I spent my last months learning and creating apps as a mob, and I finally understand all the benefits of working as a team. Multiple heads do think better than just one!

Now, I keep building apps to further cement everything we learned on our bootcamp, as well as learning new technologies that will bring value to companies.
